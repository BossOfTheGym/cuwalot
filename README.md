# cuwalot
Tree-based memory allocator. Utilizes red-black trees. The best allocator in the universe that is... ineffective as hell.
Now it is sealed so no more changes and work here will be done.

## Features
- it works
- it is slow
- is is handmade
- and it uses red-black tree & doubly-linked list :D
- ... and some fancy in-memory pools :D
- this project is sealed and here will be no development in the nearest future
